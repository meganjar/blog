# Full Stack Lab: The Blog

You're given the frontend logic for a Blog application. Currently, it uses localStorage to
simulate the data and the backend logic. 

Task:

- Create the backend for this application using Express and MongoDB
- The structure of the data can be found in the data.js file (in the frontend)
- Focus on CRUD functionality for "posts" (ignore anything related to "comments")
- A few routes are required:

    GET /posts
    GET /posts/:id
    POST /posts
    PUT /posts/:id
    DELETE /posts/:id

- Finish the backend and test it with Postman or Thunder Client, then connect it to the frontend
- In the frontend, look for anything that references "data" - this is related to localStorage and can be deleted
